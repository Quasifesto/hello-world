# hello-world
Middle-aged librarian wants to learn to code for reasons he does not yet understand. 

### Interests Include:

*Music- I'm a drummer and I have built 2 cigar box guitars
*Zines - Aside from making the occasional zine myself, I have a small distro and I am working on ceating a zine library
*Tech - I'm an informed user who would like to be a "power user." I've recently switched to Linux operating systems and now I'm trying github and markdown.
